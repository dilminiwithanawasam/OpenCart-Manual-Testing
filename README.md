# OpenCart E-Commerce Manual Testing Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive manual testing project performed on the **OpenCart** e-commerce platform. The goal of this project was to practice professional QA documentation and end-to-end manual testing methodologies, ensuring the application is functional, user-friendly, and bug-free.

I developed this as a practice project, referencing industry-standard practices from **Ganga Panday’s** QA repository and following various YouTube tutorials to align with professional software testing standards.

## Objectives

* To gain hands-on experience in the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).
* To create professional testing artifacts including Test Plans and Test Cases.
* To identify, document, and track software defects (Bug Reporting).
* To practice functional and non-functional testing on a live e-commerce environment.

## Testing Artifacts

The repository includes the following documentation:

* **Test Plan:** Outlines the strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for the OpenCart testing project.
* **Test Scenarios:** High-level scenarios covering various modules (Registration, Login, Search, Shopping Cart, Checkout).
* **Test Cases:** Detailed step-by-step test cases with expected results, actual results, and status (Pass/Fail).
* **Bug Reports:** A log of identified defects with severity, priority, and steps to reproduce.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** (If applicable) Mapping requirements to test cases to ensure full coverage.


## Key Learnings

* Understanding how to write effective and clear bug reports.
* Creating comprehensive test cases that cover both positive and negative scenarios.
* Learning the importance of a structured Test Plan in a QA project.
* Familiarity with e-commerce business logic and common edge cases.
